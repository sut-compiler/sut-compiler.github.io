## Course Description
This course is tailored for students interested in the foundational concepts of computer science, focusing on the design and construction of compilers. Despite the limited variety in compiler construction methodologies, these techniques are versatile and can be applied to create interpreters and translators for a broad and diverse spectrum of languages and machines. In this course, students will be introduced to the main components of a compiler, their functions, and their interrelationships. Beginning with an overview of compiler components and various grammars, the course will detail the different phases of translation, including lexical analysis, syntactic analysis, semantic analysis, and code generation and optimization.
